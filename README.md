#utilized bootstrap and react-bootstrap for premade react bootstrap components.
#used prop drilling to pass props through to other component elements.
#react-spinners made loading micoanimation for formSubmission Event
#video autoplay implementation for great home page design
#react-toastify makes it very easy to get front-end submission animations for better UI/UX. (submission notification, "Thankyou...")
#emailjs API allows forms to gmail backend notifications extremely easy (Form Submission to linked Gmail Acc)
#simple CSS increases overall website when done with contrast, planning, etc.
#microanimation which bring sites to life (navbar after certain screen length becomes solid color, button hover affects)
#should leave a nice margin between block components elements, in other words, leaving whitespace is good.

## Tips

#leave lots of whitespace (margin) on nav element as in chrome, as you scroll down, the mobile browser will add margin from top.
#to allow box-shadow on all form elements (including iOS safari mobile, as the mobile view on iOS phones tends to not show box-shadow) check commented syles on ContactContent.css file.
